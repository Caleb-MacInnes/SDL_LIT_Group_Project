/*
Caleb: 
Added a number of platforms. Stairs, a wall with a ledge, a long platform, and an overhead block.
The stairs gradually increase in intensity, for testing purposes. The highest increase is currently 25.
Also made some changes to the main, but didn't figure it warranted a new file; just increased window size.
Specifically, X and Y to 50 from 100, and width and height from (640, 480) to (1280, 960).

With high enough velocity and a thin enough platform, the character can jump right through them. Something to be careful of.
This is because the player overlaps with the platform a bit on contact, depending on velocity. This also allows stairs to work,
albeit at the cost of slowing the player. Maybe we can turn this into a gameplay element? Side collisions lower vertical speed?
Also brings to mind wall jumping/clinging.
